                    I’ve always liked making things. From sketching app ideas and building a Minecraft server site for friends to experimenting with Weebly and Wix, wanting full control I moved away from templates, drag-and-drop builders to coding everything by hand. That curiosity pushed me into learning how the web really works.

                    I taught myself web development through courses and video tutorials on

                        Team Treehouse
                    </a>
                    and YouTube. With a lot of experimenting I started with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then expanded into server-side work and deployment. Along the way I picked up Node.js and Express for quick APIs, FastAPI for Python-based services, and Nginx for reverse proxying. More recently I’ve been using
                    <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/">
                        Cloudflare Workers and Pages

                    Why I built the site this way
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a portfolio, I wanted something that loads fast, is easy to maintain and is accessible worldwide. That's why the frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using a lightweight, framework-free approach keeps page weight down and means faster initial loads for visitors and recruiters. I do in the future want to explore frameworks like React or Svelte for more complex projects, but for now simplicity and performance are key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hosting on Cloudflare Workers &amp; Pages gives me edge delivery and simple serverless endpoints. In practice this means static assets are cached close to users, and small dynamic routes can be served without managing a full server. Where a traditional server is needed, for my API servers I use Node.js and FastAPI behind Nginx for routing and proxying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also connect a few third party services where they make sense. Forms use
                    <a href="https://formspree.io/">
                        Formspree
                    </a>
                    so I can simply collect messages without building backend, protected by Google reCAPTCHA to reduce spam. Google Analytics helps me understand how people find and use the site. These are practical choices that save time while keeping control.

                    Performance, accessibility and discoverability are important, they matter for search engine indexing and reaching users. My Lighthouse scores for this website reflect that work:

                <p>
                    Whilst building the site, I wanted an efficient way to manage content and deploy updates. To do this, I created a custom static site generator (SSG) using Python. This tool automates the process of converting markdown files into HTML pages, applying consistent templates and styles. It saves time and effort when adding new articles or updating existing ones, ensuring that the site remains easy to maintain as it grows.

                    I could have used a CMS or an existing SSG like Jekyll or Hugo, but building my own gave me more control and a deeper understanding of how static sites work under the hood. Whilst making a dynamic site with maybe a CMS and database would have been interesting, sometimes simpler is better, especially for a portfolio site where performance and reliability are key.

                    I plan to build more complex apps using modern frameworks and web binaries when a project needs them, but I keep returning to the principle of choosing the right tool for the job. I’m also experimenting more with serverless projects, dockerised environments and microservices so I can ship reliable systems that are easy to debug and scale.

                    Building this website has been a practical way to show what I can do: design, code, deploy and measure a site that people can actually use. I’m always learning, and I’m keen to bring this approach to a team that values clean, accessible and well engineered web and app experiences, front and back end.
